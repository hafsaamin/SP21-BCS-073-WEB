                        <span>webydo.com <br></span> 
                        Designers are terrified of imitation and they have reason to be wary. Take, for example, the
                        story of Japanese designer Kenjiro Sano, who designed the logo for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games
                        and was later accused of ripping a Belgian theater with a nearly identical emblem.
                        A scandal ensued, the Tokyo Olympic Committee scrapped Sano’s design entirely and his reputation
                        was ruined...
